# My-Netflix-Activity
I found out via Twitter that Netflix allows its users to download their account data, in that data there's a csv file called ViewingActivity which contains activities of all the profiles in an account. I have 5 profiles in my account, and for this analysis, we are going to focus on my profile named "nelson".
