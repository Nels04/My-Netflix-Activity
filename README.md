# My-Netflix-Activity
I found out via Twitter that Netflix allows its users to download their account data, in that data there's a csv file called ViewingActivity which contains activities of all the profiles in an account. I have 5 profiles in my account, and for this analysis, we are going to focus on my profile named "nelson". 

## Goals
 * The main goal of this project is to find out how much time I have spent watching New Girl between 2017-2020.
 * During which month of which year I've watched New Girl the most(It'll probably be between March and August 2020, covid-19 quarantine).
 * Which episode I've watched the most?
